# Arkadiko Bug Bounty Program
The security of Arkadiko’s systems is of the highest priority for our team and the Bug Bounty Program is a key component of our strategy to maximize security. We’ll reward you for helping us make the system as invulnerable as possible. Happy hunting!

## Rewards
The submitted issue needs to meet a minimum severity standard of Low as described below in order to qualify for a reward. A successfully-reviewed submission will receive a reward in DIKO tokens based on the classified severity of the issue.

**Low:**
- An issue that could theoretically cause a loss of less than 1% of the protocol funds, damage the protocol state, or cause severe user dissatisfaction or moderate technical failure.
- Up to 50.000 DIKO

**Medium:**
- An issue that could cause the immediate loss of protocol funds between 1% and 10%, or severely damage the protocol state.
- Up to 200.000 DIKO

**High:**
- An issue that could cause immediate loss of over 10% of the protocol funds or permanently impair the protocol state.
- Up to 500.000 DIKO
