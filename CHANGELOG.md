## Version 0.9.2

- Add dynamic smart contract function parameters for collateral types

## Version 0.9.1

- Add pending & confirmed transactions in sidebar

## Version 0.9.0

- Add basic swapping functionality to trade tokens (xUSD, DIKO, STX)

## Version 0.8.1

- Fix governance votes from UI
- Add governance method to add a new registered smart contract to DAO

## Version 0.8.0

- Rename all smart contracts to use an `arkadiko-` prefix and a major-minor version postfix (e.g. `v1-1`). Smart contracts that never change don't have a version postfix. Traits only have a major version, since the whole (part of the) protocol changes when traits change.
- Mint DIKO tokens for the foundation and founders, vested over 4 years time.
- Add DIKO rewards for people who provide STX liquidity through vaults in the first 6 weeks of mainnet launch
- Add 50 million DIKO staking rewards, distributed over 5 years time, with 25 million DIKO staking rewards in the first year
- Implement better UI validations for staking and creating vaults

## Version 0.7.0

- Add stacking logic to pay out vaults that have STX collateral. If a vault gets liquidated during a stacking cycle, the vault owner will not be eligible for the yield. The yield will be paid out to the winners of the auctions.

## Version 0.6.1

### New features

- Allow on-chain governance proposal voting with DIKO or stDIKO
- Claim back tokens after proposal ends

## Version 0.6.0

### New features

- Add staking pools and registry. Currently a DIKO staking pool is implemented, which gives DIKO rewards for staking, with the option to add staking for other fungible tokens in the future (e.g. a DIKO LP token or even stablecoins).

## Version 0.5.0

### New features

- Allow contract versioning through trait implementations. The current smart contracts have a trait definition:
  - Auction Engine
  - Collateral Types
  - Liquidator
  - Oracle
  - Staking (WIP)
  - Vault Manager (Freddie)

## Version 0.4.0

### New features

- When the amount of collateral in a normal collateral liquidation auction does not cover the xUSD debt, a debt auction will be started afterwards. A debt auction sells governance tokens from the Arkadiko pool to cover bad debt in the system.

## Version 0.3.1

### New features

- Implement DAO kill switch (emergency shutdown) to disable vault actions

## Version 0.3.0

### New Features

- Improve auction logic by selling lots of 100 xUSD

## Version 0.2.0

### New Features

- When STX collateral is stacked in PoX and a vault needs to be liquidated, an equivalent amount of xSTX tokens will be minted that are interchangeable for STX once they get unlocked from PoX. Instead of STX, the xSTX tokens will be auctioned off. Owning the xSTX will also make you eligible to get the rewards from PoX for the corresponding STX tokens.
